Configuration protocol(derived from OpenFlow):

Controller needs to maintain a table containing all current flows in the network, and automatically remove the flows after they expires(delete from table and inform all relevant switches).

Once Controller received a request to set up a circuit:
1) Based on existing flows and network topology, generate a possible circuit.
2) Send Configuration messages(TCP) to all switches:
	For CSwtich:  UP_srcID_srcLambda_destID_destLambda_Timeslot 
		Reply: 1/0 (succeed or fail)
	For CPSwitch:	UP_srchostID_desthostID_destID_destLambda_Timeslot
		Reply: 1/0 (succeed or fail)

3) To remove flow from switches:
	For CSwtich:  DOWN_srcID_srcLambda_destID_destLambda_Timeslot 
		Reply: 1/0 (succeed or fail)
	For CPSwitch:	DOWN_srchostID_desthostID_destID_destLambda_Timeslot
		Reply: 1/0 (succeed or fail)
